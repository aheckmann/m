# m - MongoDB Version Manager

`m` helps you download, use, and manage multiple versions of the MongoDB server
and command-line tools.

This can be useful for development & testing environments. For example, testing
release upgrades/downgrades or potential behavior differences between versions.

Where possible `m` will try to download the distro-specific binaries for your
O/S and version. If a binary appears to be unavailable, `m` will ask if you want
to try building from source.

NOTE: [Building MongoDB from source](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/wiki/Build-Mongodb-From-Source)
requires you to preinstall all of the relevant dependencies & toolchain to build
the desired version of MongoDB. Installing those is outside the scope of what
`m` does.

## Prerequisites

To install binary packages `m` requires a 64-bit O/S which:
 - is a [Supported Platform for the version of MongoDB you are trying to install](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/production-notes/#supported-platforms)
 - includes the `bash` shell

Environments that should work include:
 - Linux (RHEL/CentOS, Debian/Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)
 - macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) and later
 - Windows 10 with [Ubuntu on Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab)
 - Docker using a supported Linux distro

## Installation

`m` is a `bash` script which can be installed & updated via `npm` for convenience:

    $ npm install -g m

or installed by cloning the GitHub repo and running `make install`:

    $ git clone git@github.com:aheckmann/m.git && cd m && make install

or fetched via `wget` and copied to a location of your choice:

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheckmann/m/master/bin/m && chmod +x ./m

### Downloading MongoDB Binaries

Specify a MongoDB server version to try download a binary package (if available for your current O/S) or switch to a previously downloaded copy. After `m` successfully downloads or switches to a specified version of MongoDB, those binaries will become the default in the install path (typically `/usr/local/bin/`; see _Details_ below for more information).

    $ m 3.2.16
    $ m 3.4.9

You can also specify a release series to download the latest available revision:

    $ m 3.6
    $ m 4.0

List installed binaries:

    $ m

      3.2.16
    Î¿ 3.4.9
      3.6.0-rc1

Use or download the latest official release:

    $ m latest

Use or download the stable official release:

    $ m stable

Check what the latest available release is:

    $ m --latest
    $ m --latest 3.6

Check what the current stable release is:

    $ m --stable
    $ m --stable 3.6

Download a custom or patched version of MongoDB from a tarball:

    $ m custom 3.5.13-me https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tarball/r3.5.13

Download and build a version of MongoDB from source (NOTE: assumes [build requirements](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/wiki/Build-Mongodb-From-Source) are installed):

    $ m 3.6.5 source

Download an Enterprise release:

    $ m 3.4.9-ent

Select a MongoDB version without prompting for confirmation if a download is required:

    $ yes | m 4.0.0

### Downloading MongoDB Database Tools

The Database Tools (mongodump, mongorestore, etc.) are now released separately from the server. You can use `m` to manage your MongoDB Database Tools version independently of your MongoDB server and shell versions.

List available Database Tools versions:

    $ m tools ls

List installed Database Tools versions:

    $ m tools installed

Use or download the latest stable release of the Database Tools:

    $ m tools stable

Use or download a specific version of the Database Tools:

    $ m tools 100.0.0

### Removing Binaries

Remove some previously installed versions:

    $  m rm 3.2.16 3.5.13-me

### Binary Usage

Multiple versions of MongoDB can be downloaded and targeted directly.

Ask `m` for the binary path for a specific version that has already been downloaded:

    $ m bin 3.4.9
    /usr/local/m/versions/3.4.9/bin/

Ask `m` for the binary path for the latest revision of a release already downloaded:

    $ m bin 3.6
    /usr/local/m/versions/3.6.5/bin/

Start up `mongod` 3.4.9 regardless of the active version:

    $ m use 3.4.9 --port 29000 --dbpath /data/3.4.9/

Execute a script with the 3.4.9 `mongo` shell regardless of the active version:

    $ m shell 3.4.9 some.js

Execute a script with a 3.4.9 `mongo` shell and some additional flags:

    $ m shell 3.4.9 --port 29000 --norc

When installing or changing the active version you might want to run custom scripts:

    $ m pre install /path/to/my/script
    $ m post install /path/to/script
    $ m pre change /path/to/my/script
    $ m post change /path/to/script

Multiple scripts may be added for any event. To add two `pre change` scripts:

    $ m pre change /path/to/script1
    $ m pre change /path/to/script2

Scripts are executed in the order they were added.

List all pre change hooks:

    $ m pre change

    /path/to/script1
    /path/to/script2

List all post install hooks:

    $ m post install

    /path/to/scriptA
    /path/to/scriptB
    /path/to/scriptC

To remove a post install hook:

    $ m post install rm /path/to/scriptB

To remove all post install hooks:

    $ m post install rm

## Details

 By default `m` downloads MongoDB binaries to _/usr/local/m/versions_ in subdirectories named after the release version (3.2.16, 3.4.9, ...). MongoDB Database Tools binaries are downloaded to _/usr/local/m/tools/versions_ in subdirectories named after the release version (100.0.0, 100.0.1, ...). Activated MongoDB binaries are symlinked into the `bin` directory in _/usr/local_.  To alter where `m` operates, export the __M_PREFIX__ environment variable with your preferred path prefix.

Previously downloaded versions of MongoDB can be activated using `m <version>` or
selected using of the variations in the _Binary Usage_ section above.

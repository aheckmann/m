# m - MongoDB Version Manager

`m` helps you download, use, and manage multiple versions of the MongoDB server
and command-line tools.

## Prerequisites

To install binary packages, `m` requires a 64-bit O/S which:
 - is a [Supported Platform for the version of MongoDB you are trying to install](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/production-notes/#supported-platforms)
 - includes the `bash` shell

Environments that should work include:
 - Linux (RHEL/CentOS, Debian/Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)
 - macOS 10.14 (Mojave) and later
 - Windows 10 with [Ubuntu on Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab)
 - Docker using a supported Linux distro

## Installation

`m` is a `bash` script which can be installed & updated via `npm` for convenience:

```bash
npm install -g m
# pnpm add -g m
# yarn global add m
```

or installed by cloning the GitHub repo and running `make install`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aheckmann/m.git && cd m && make install
```

or fetched via `wget` and copied to a location of your choice:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheckmann/m/master/bin/m && chmod +x ./m
```

### Downloading MongoDB Binaries


To install or activate a previously installed version, run `m <version>`.
For example:

```bash
$ m 7.0.14
```

Afterwards, those binaries will become the default in your install path (typically `$HOME/.local/bin/`; see [Details](#details) below for more information).

You can also specify a release series to download the latest available revision:

```bash
$ m 7.0
$ m 8.0
```

List installed binaries:

```bash
$ m

    7.0.14
  * 8.0.6
```

Use or download the latest official release:

```bash
$ m latest
```

Use or download the stable official release:

```bash
$ m stable
```

Check what the latest available release is:

```bash
$ m --latest
$ m --latest 7.0
```

Check what the current stable release is:

```bash
$ m --stable
$ m --stable 7.0
```

Download an Enterprise release:

```bash
$ m 7.0-ent
```

Select a MongoDB version without prompting for confirmation if a download is required:

```bash
$ yes | m 7.0
```

#### Notes

Where possible `m` will try to download the distro-specific binaries for your
O/S and version. If a binary appears to be unavailable, `m` will ask if you want
to try building from source.

[Building MongoDB from source](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/wiki/Build-Mongodb-From-Source)
requires you to preinstall all of the relevant dependencies & toolchain to build
the desired version of MongoDB. Installing those is outside the scope of what
`m` does.


### Downloading MongoDB Database Tools

The Database Tools (mongodump, mongorestore, etc.) are released separately from the server. You can use `m` to manage your MongoDB Database Tools version independently of your MongoDB server and shell versions.

List available Database Tools versions:

```bash
$ m tools ls
```

List installed Database Tools versions:

```bash
$ m tools installed
```

Use or download the latest stable release of the Database Tools:

```bash
$ m tools stable
```

Use or download a specific version of the Database Tools:

```bash
$ m tools 100.9.4
```

### Removing Binaries

Remove some previously installed versions:

```bash
$  m rm 6.0.13 7.0.5
```

### Binary Usage

Multiple versions of MongoDB can be downloaded and targeted directly.

Ask `m` for the binary path for a specific version that has already been downloaded:

```bash
$ m bin 7.0.6
/Users/bobbytables/.local/m/versions/7.0.6/bin
```

Start up `mongod` 6.0.13 regardless of the active version:

```bash
$ m use 6.0.13 --port 29000 --dbpath ./data/
```

When installing or changing the active version you might want to run custom scripts:

```bash
$ m pre install /path/to/my/script
$ m post install /path/to/script
$ m pre change /path/to/my/script
$ m post change /path/to/script
```

Multiple scripts may be added for any event. To add two `pre change` scripts:

```bash
$ m pre change /path/to/script1
$ m pre change /path/to/script2
```

Scripts are executed in the order they were added.

List all pre change hooks:

```bash
$ m pre change

/path/to/script1
/path/to/script2
```

List all post install hooks:

```bash
$ m post install

/path/to/scriptA
/path/to/scriptB
/path/to/scriptC
```

To remove a post install hook:

```bash
$ m post install rm /path/to/scriptB
```

To remove all post install hooks:

```bash
$ m post install rm
```

## Details

 By default `m` downloads MongoDB binaries to _~/.local/m/versions_ in subdirectories named after the release version (6.0.14, 7.0.6, ...). MongoDB Database Tools binaries are downloaded to _~/.local/m/tools/versions_ in subdirectories named after the release version (100.0.0, 100.0.1, ...). Activated MongoDB binaries are symlinked into the `bin` directory in _~/.local/bin_.  To alter where `m` operates, export the __M_PREFIX__ environment variable with your preferred path prefix.

Previously downloaded versions of MongoDB can be activated using `m <version>` or
selected using of the variations in the _Binary Usage_ section above.
